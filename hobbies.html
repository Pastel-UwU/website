    <p>I like Minecraft, Roblox, Music and sports, also TV. Minecraft is so laggy and you need to have 5G or else you will get kicked out of the game in the most excited part. Minecraft is better than Roblox because there are no hastags when you chat. But the bad thing is you cannot private chat.</p>
